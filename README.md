# Responsive grid of hexagons with CSS grid layout.
This branch uses **css grid** to layout the hexagons. The markup is unchanged, changes have only been made in the CSS file.

CSS grid layout makes the spacing calculations easier to understand and work with.
The features are the same but browser support is not as good a the flexbox version.

## Flexbox vs CSS grid
This branch uses **flexbox** to layout the hexagons. Another version using **CSS grid layout** is availbale on the [css-grid branch](https://github.com/web-tiki/responsive-grid-of-hexagons/tree/css-grid).  
CSS grid has lower browser support than flexbox (see [canIuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)) but makes the hexagon spacing easier to understand and work with.

## Features
*Same as flexbox version*

## Text and hover effect:
*Same as flexbox version*

## Changing the number of hexagons per row:
*Same as flexbox version* except that the width of the hexagons is defined by the `grid-column-end: span 2;` (each hexagon spans on 2 columns) property and only needs to be defined once. The number of columns is changed with the `grid-template-columns` property in the media queries.

To **change the number of hexagons per row**, you need to:

### Change the number of columns

with the `grid-template-columns` property. 
The value `repeat(4,1fr)` repeats 4 times `1fr` so it makes 4 columns.   
As each hexagon spans 2 columns, there are 2 hexagons on even rows.


### Indent even rows
The even rows (2nd, 4th,6th...) are indented with `grid-column-start: 2;` on the first hexagon of even rows.

**The selector:**  
*Same as flexbox version*

**Value of margin-left:**
*Not needed anymore*
